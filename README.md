# JsBasic
Layout for an ancient Javascript page with no Javascript! 

I like the colors in this one. Its an ancient looking webpage but it was made to spec.
One mistake I remember making is typing out the content on the .txt file, I did not create the full tag for most emphasis to "try and save time"
it did not really work out that way.
