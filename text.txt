p  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.  /p

    -link (Variable Declaration) Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. <span var x;>

    -link (Variable Assignment) Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span var x = 10>

    -link (Data Types) Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span true> or <span false;> null - <span null> aka nothing; Number - <span 42> or <span 3.14159;> String - <span "Coding Dojo Rocks!";> Array - <span [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']> and Object - <span {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}>

    -link (Conditionals) When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following contiional statements: <span if> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span else if> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span else> we execute this block of code;

    -link (Loops) There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!

    -link (Function) Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.  Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
